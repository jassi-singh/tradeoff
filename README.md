Welcome to **TradeOff**! This is a real-time, massively multiplayer stock market simulator designed to provide all the thrill of high-stakes trading in compressed, 10-minute rounds, with zero financial risk.

This project is being built in public as a comprehensive case study in full-stack application development, product design, and scalable system architecture. You can follow the progress and my learnings on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jassiD2000) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaswinder-singh-32a01118b/).

## The Vision: A Three-Phase Architectural Journey

This project is planned to evolve through three distinct phases, demonstrating a professional approach to building and scaling a modern web application.

### Phase 1: The Multiplayer Core ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- **Goal:** Build a functional, engaging, multiplayer version of the game with real-time trading capabilities.
- **Architecture:** Monolith (Single Go Backend + Next.js Frontend).
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete** - Full multiplayer support with real-time trading

### Phase 2: The Live Leaderboard ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- **Goal:** Add a live leaderboard that displays active user count and player rankings in real-time.
- **Architecture:** The application remains a **Monolith**, enhanced with leaderboard functionality.
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete** - Live leaderboard with real-time player rankings

### Phase 3: The Scalability Case Study ‚è≥ **NEXT**

- **Goal:** Use professional load-testing tools (`k6`) to prove the monolith's performance limits under simulated multiplayer load, and then evolve the architecture to solve those bottlenecks.
- **Architecture:** Refactor the system into an **Evolved Microservices Architecture**. Key components (e.g., data ingestion, trade processing) will be extracted into separate, scalable services.
- **Status:** ‚è≥ **Planned**

_[This README will be updated with "Before vs. After" performance benchmark graphs upon completion of Phase 3.]_

## Getting Started

This project is fully containerized with Docker, providing a consistent and easy-to-manage development environment.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) & Docker Compose

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jassi-singh/tradeoff.git
    cd tradeoff
    ```

2.  **Configure Backend Environment:**
    The backend requires a `.env` file with credentials for the database and the Polygon.io API.

    First, copy the example file:

    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    ```

    Next, **edit `backend/.env`** and add your Polygon API key. The `DATABASE_URL` is already configured for the Docker environment.

    ```env
    # backend/.env

    # Port for the backend server
    PORT=8080

    # PostgreSQL Connection URL (configured for Docker)
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@postgres:5432/tradeoff?sslmode=disable"

    # API Key for Polygon.io (REQUIRED)
    POLYGON_API_KEY="YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY" # <--- ADD YOUR KEY HERE
    ```

3.  **Configure Frontend Environment:**
    The frontend needs to know the backend's URL. Copy the example file. No edits are needed for the default Docker setup.

    ```bash
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    Use Docker Compose to build the images and start all services (frontend, backend, and database).

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    - The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
    - The PostgreSQL database will be accessible on port `5432`.

    Once the containers are running, the backend will automatically create the necessary database tables.

### Alternative: Running Services Manually

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run each service manually. For detailed instructions, see the README file within its directory:

- **[Backend README](./backend/README.md)**
- **[Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)**

## Game Rules & Mechanics

### Game Phases

1. **Lobby (15 seconds)**: Players join and wait for the trading round to begin
2. **Live (1 minute)**: Active trading phase where players can create and close positions
3. **Cooldown (10 seconds)**: Brief pause before the next round begins

### Trading Mechanics

- **Starting Balance**: $100 USD per player per round
- **Position Types**: Long (betting price goes up) or Short (betting price goes down)
- **Position Limits**: One active position per player at a time
- **P&L Calculation**: Real-time based on current market price vs entry price
- **Market Data**: Real Bitcoin/USD historical data from Polygon.io

### Multiplayer Features

- **Concurrent Players**: Multiple players can join the same game session
- **Real-time Updates**: All players see live price movements and position changes
- **Player Statistics**: Live tracking of total players, long/short position counts
- **Session Management**: Players maintain their positions and balances throughout the round
